# About Me!

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, specializing in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My research focuses on improving health monitoring systems, specifically gait analysis and fall risk prediction for older adults with dementia. I have extensive experience in pose estimation, human activity recognition, and visual detection.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Toronto (2021 - Present)**  
  Thesis: Computer Vision-based human pose estimation, gait assessment, and fall risk prediction in older adults with dementia.  

- **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2015 - 2018)**  
  Thesis: Multi-Stream Human Action Recognition Using Spatiotemporal Saliency Maps  
 
- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2010 - 2014)**  
  Thesis: Object Recognition Using RGB-D Data  

## Projects

- **[AMBIENT Project](https://github.com/vida-adeli/AMBIENT-Project)**: Using computer vision technology to analyze gait and predict short-term falls risk in older adults with dementia.  
  Collaborating with the KITE Research Institute at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, UHN.

- **Interaction-aware Human Pose and Motion Forecasting**: In collaboration with Stanford University and Monash University, this project focuses on predicting human motion and interactions in complex environments.  
  Partners: Prof. Hamid Rezatofighi, Prof. Ian Reid, Prof. Juan Carlos Niebles, Prof. Silvio Savarese.

- **NLP and ML-based Stock Market Performance and Risk Analysis**: Developed a machine learning model to assess stock market trends using natural language processing.  
  Supervised by Prof. Ehsan Fazl-Ersi, in collaboration with OcularAI Inc.

- **Human Physical Demand Recognition for AI Job Analysis**: Used body pose estimation techniques to assess physical demand in video-based AI job analysis.  
  Collaborated with OcularAI Inc.
