# About Me!

I am a Computer Science PhD candidate at University of Toronto, supervised by [Babak Taati](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~taati/) and [Andrea Iaboni](https://rsi.utoronto.ca/faculty/andrea-iaboni). I am also affiliated with [KITE - University Health Network](https://kite-uhn.com/) as a Research Assistant. Previously, I was a Researcher at [Vision & Learning for Autonomous AI (VL4AI) Lab](https://vl4ai.erc.monash.edu/), Monash University.

My research interests broadly span Computer Vision and Deep Learning. I am particularly interested in developing generative models, for 3D human motion analysis using various human sensing technologies, such as video and sensory data, with applications in healthcare.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Toronto (2021 - Present)**  
  Thesis: Computer Vision-based human pose estimation, gait assessment, and fall risk prediction in older adults with dementia.  

- **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2015 - 2018)**  
  Thesis: Multi-Stream Human Action Recognition Using Spatiotemporal Saliency Maps  
 
- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2010 - 2014)**  
  Thesis: Object Recognition Using RGB-D Data  

## Projects
- **Generative Model for Human Motion and Pathology Analysis**: Designed a generative model based on residual VQ-VAE with transformers and VQ-diffusions for disentangled motion and pathology representation learning and generation, particularly for Parkinson’s Disease.

- **EMotionDiffuse-GPT: Multi-modal Motion and Video Generation**: A multi-modal project integrating human motion analysis, video interpretation, and emotional/body language insights. Used Vicuna and Llama large language models (LLMs) with advanced diffusion models to generate controllable, emotion-aware motion sequences from video data. 

- **[AMBIENT Project](https://github.com/vida-adeli/AMBIENT-Project)**: Using computer vision technology to analyze gait and predict short-term falls risk in older adults with dementia.  
  Collaborating with the KITE Research Institute at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, UHN.

- **Interaction-aware Human Pose and Motion Forecasting**: In collaboration with Stanford University and Monash University, this project focuses on predicting human motion and interactions in complex environments.  
  Partners: Prof. Hamid Rezatofighi, Prof. Ian Reid, Prof. Juan Carlos Niebles, Prof. Silvio Savarese.

- **NLP and ML-based Stock Market Performance and Risk Analysis**: Developed a machine learning model to assess stock market trends using natural language processing.  
  Supervised by Prof. Ehsan Fazl-Ersi, in collaboration with OcularAI Inc.

- **Human Physical Demand Recognition for AI Job Analysis**: Used body pose estimation techniques to assess physical demand in video-based AI job analysis.  
  Collaborated with OcularAI Inc.
