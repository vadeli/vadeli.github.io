# About Me!

I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto, specializing in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. My research focuses on improving health monitoring systems, specifically gait analysis and fall risk prediction for older adults with dementia. I have extensive experience in pose estimation, human activity recognition, and visual detection.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Toronto (2021 - Present)**  
  Thesis: Computer Vision-based human pose estimation, gait assessment, and fall risk prediction in older adults with dementia.  
  Supervisors: Prof. Babak Taati, Prof. Andrea Iaboni

- **M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2015 - 2018)**  
  Thesis: Multi-Stream Human Action Recognition Using Spatiotemporal Saliency Maps  
  Supervisors: Prof. Ehsan Fazl-Ersi, Prof. Ahad Harati

- **B.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad (2010 - 2014)**  
  Thesis: Object Recognition Using RGB-D Data  
  Supervisor: Prof. Ahad Harati

## Projects

- **[AMBIENT Project](https://github.com/vida-adeli/AMBIENT-Project)**: Using computer vision technology to analyze gait and predict short-term falls risk in older adults with dementia.  
  Collaborating with the KITE Research Institute at Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, UHN.

- **Interaction-aware Human Pose and Motion Forecasting**: In collaboration with Stanford University and Monash University, this project focuses on predicting human motion and interactions in complex environments.  
  Partners: Prof. Hamid Rezatofighi, Prof. Ian Reid, Prof. Juan Carlos Niebles, Prof. Silvio Savarese.
